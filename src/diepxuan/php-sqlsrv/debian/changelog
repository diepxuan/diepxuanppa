    work - Always Encrypted requires [MS ODBC Driver
    17+](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/odbc/linux-
    mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server) - Only

    limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/php/using-
    always-encrypted-php-drivers#limitations-of-the-php-drivers-when-
    using-always-encrypted) Known Issues - This release requires ODBC
    Driver 17.4.2 or above. Otherwise, a warning about failing to set an
    attribute may be suppressed when using an older ODBC driver. -
    Connection pooling on Linux or macOS is not recommended with
    [unixODBC](http://www.unixodbc.org/) < 2.3.7 - When pooling is
    enabled in Linux or macOS - unixODBC <= 2.3.4 (Linux and macOS)
    might not return proper diagnostic information, such as error
    messages, warnings and informative messages - due to this unixODBC
    bug, fetch large data (such as xml, binary) as streams as a
    workaround. See the examples
    [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/wiki/Features#pooling)
